                  <br> Recommendation: He is very accepting, patient and open-minded. For example, I came out as queer, and he was very supportive. In Sydney especially, it is very hard to find a doctor (especially if you're from a multicultural background) who will not be dismissive of you, especially if your symptoms are not very obvious. So I would reccommend this doctor for anyone in the Parramatta area needing a GP who won't judge them, and will take their concerns seriously. I felt very comfortable with him, as he explained concepts that I was confused about, and will ask consent/explain procedures before they happen. He has seen other patients from multicultural, neurodiverse and queer backgrounds. He works with a wide range of patients, and has experience in both physical and mental health issues. Since he is a GP, I have found he has a general knowledge about these issues, but he is always willing to do research and tries his best to help you find the services you need.
