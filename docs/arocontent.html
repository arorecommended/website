                  <br>Description: A Carnival of Aros is a blogging carnival, which is an event where various people blog around a single topic.  At the end of the carnival, a host blog collects all the links.  It’s a way of encouraging a variety of different voices, and a way to bring attention to blogs that would otherwise go under the radar.
                  <br>The Carnival of Aros is a monthly blogging carnival centered on aromantic and aro-spec identities and experiences.
