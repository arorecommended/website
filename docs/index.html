            <h2>Welcome to Aro Recommended!</h2>
            <p>This is a site for people on the aromantic spectrum, known as aros for short, to recommend providers, professionals, and content creators to 
                other aros. We also encourage aros to recommend themselves so that we can support our community memebers. If you are a professional who is not aro yourself, 
                but are culturally competent with the aro community, and would like to list your services, that is also welcome. </p>
            <p>Recommendations can be found at the links above organized by category, and then location on each page. If you would like to add a recommendation, 
            please do so at the <a href="submit.html">Submit a Recommendation</a> page!</p>
            
            <h3>If you've had great experiences with a professional, or if you're aro yourself and would like to be added <a href="https://forms.gle/Zoa2AwXSbqaT3TYWA">make a recommendation here!</a>.</h2>
