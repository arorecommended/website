                  <br>Recommendation: Kai is an open person who is particularly understanding of fluidity and the spectrum of experiences an a-spec person might have. Things are not simply black and white or able to be put into boxes, and they are someone dedicated to working with you as a an equal learner.

                  <br>Recommendation: Wonderful! Theyre non-binary and mixed race (japanese european). Very strong anti oppression and feminist approach. Super good at chronic illness and disability stuff. Not super knowledgable on aro terminology but always very open to learninb. Often familiar with the concepts of things like amatonormativity without knowing the word for it.

                  <br>Fees: $141.25 (Canadian) per hour
                  <br>Recommendation: While talking about being aro has rarely been a significant part of our session, when it does come up I felt comfortable talking about it with her response. On one occasion the majority of our session focused on the ways that I feel dehumanized by aro (and ace) coding of non-human characters in fiction, and her responses and discussion with me was helpful and respectful.

                  <br>Recommendation: I've been seeing this therapist for 2 years and he's by far the best I've ever had. I'm trans, aromantic, asexual, and a trauma survivor and he has been wonderful and understanding for all of those things. He has a lot of experience working with queer people and is very familiar with assisting patients with legal issues.

                  <br>Recommendation: I had him as a therapist through my college (IUP), but he also has a small private practice. When summer break started and the university stopped paying him, he even gave me a couple months of pro bono teletherapy sessions because he knew I couldn't pay out of pocket. He's been incredibly accepting and supportive of me being aromantic, asexual, and nonbinary. He's an incredibly kind and supportive therapist in general, who truly cares about his work and wants what's best for all of his patients. His only flaw is that he sometimes gets too optimistic about my

                  <br>Recommendation: This is my therapist, and she's very good. I'm out to her as asexual and she didn't react negatively about it at all. She did her thesis work on LGBTQ+ patients. I can't recommend her highly enough.
