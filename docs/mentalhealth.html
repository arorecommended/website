                  <br>Fees: 140 CAD/50 minute session
                  <br>Recommendation: Mark is an OCD specialist who has changed my life. I am aro and ace, and while it doesnâ€™t come up often in our sessions, when it does he understands it completely and is fully culturally competent in the area. I never have to explain it to him or worry that he will be dismissive or think that my symptoms are related to my identity. He spent 5 years studying asexuality and non-binary gender identity, so while aromanticism was not at the forefront of this research, he came across it regularly and is experienced with all of the concepts. He is also just a great therapist. (Recommended October 2020)

                  <br>Recommendation: While talking about being aro has rarely been a significant part of our session, when it does come up I felt comfortable talking about it with her response. On one occasion the majority of our session focused on the ways that I feel dehumanized by aro (and ace) coding of non-human characters in fiction, and her responses and discussion with me was helpful and respectful.

She's also extremely affirming on matters of gender; I likewise told her early on that I'm a bit gender squishy and not too pressed about figuring out exactly how I identify, and she's been entirely respectful about that - honestly, she takes more care not to refer to me as solely female than I do.

She said yes, and I explained that I'm aroace and that I wanted to say that early on because I know some people consider being aspec to be a mental disorder. She does not consider being aspec a mental disorder, and she was receptive to my coming out to her. I've talked to her a little about how amatonormativity affects me and that I get squishes, although I'm still trying to get more comfortable with talking about my squishes. Dr. Conrad is the second therapist I've worked with, and a significant improvement over my previous one. Sessions with her really help me talk through what I'm thinking about.

                  <br>Website: <a href="https://www.DoBetterWellness.com" target="_blank">Do Better Wellness Corp</a>  | Sara@DoBetterWellness.com
                  <br>(918) 928-2809 
                  <br>Fees: Sliding scale based on income
                  <br>Recommendation: Former therapist, now runs a non-profit for education, mentoring, and therapeutic coaching. Comprehensive wellness services. These include, but are not limited to: physical wellness, job-hunting services, financial services (such as creating a budget or creating a debt reduction plan), self-esteem training, etc. 
                        I've been seeing Sara both in person and via online meetings two years now. They're queer and heavily involved in the local LGBTQ+ community in Tulsa, OK. I've found them very supportive and knowledgeable about queer/general aromantic concepts. (Recommended February 2021)

                  <br>(814) 577-8360 | Pennsylvania
                  <br>Fees: $150/hour
                  <br>Recommendation: I had him as a therapist through my college (IUP), but he also has a small private practice. When summer break started and the university stopped paying him, he even gave me a couple months of pro bono teletherapy sessions because he knew I couldn't pay out of pocket. He's been incredibly accepting and supportive of me being aromantic, asexual, and nonbinary. He's an incredibly kind and supportive therapist in general, who truly cares about his work and wants what's best for all of his patients. His only flaw is that he sometimes gets too optimistic about my progress and doesn't always catch on to my maladaptive patterns until I point them out. (Recommended October 2020)
